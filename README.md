# Learning Docker Deployment

## Thanks to [Elton Stoneman](https://github.com/sixeyed) for creating this Plural Sight course [Deploying Containerized Application](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/deploying-containerized-applications)

### Overview
This is the course material which I'll be using as a reference to create docker-compose.yml or Docker file in future, as this has used the best practices and perfect models.
Course gave an indepth understanding of 
* Docker Compose
* Docker Swarm
* Kubernetes
* ACI & ECS
